BUCKET PROBLEM (Stop when 80 percent is done)
There is a Bucket of water capacity of x litres, which is supposed to fill with a mug of y millilitres water capacity. Say for example x=100 and y=10 then, bucket will get full of minimum of 8 mugs (> 80% and

less than 100%>

Bucket filling is to be stopped once more than 80% of bucket capacity is filled. The amount of water taken at a time in mug is not fixed as it can be any value less than or equal to y

Notify to stop once bucket is full that is more than

80% of capacity of bucket and count number of mugs

poured into bucket.

Note that Bucket capacity will always be greater that

Mug's Capacity.

Example 1: INPUT VALUES //

//Enter Amount of water in MUG one after other as
